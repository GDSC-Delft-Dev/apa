# APA
Autonomous Precision Agriculture with UAVs

## About the project 
This mobile application aims to provide farmers with localized insights about their fields, by using drone technology to capture multi-spectral images of their crops. 
Insights are generated by our image processing pipeline, as well as our high-fidelity agricultural data source.   
Through an intuitive dashboard, farmers are able to automatically track historical field status. 
We strive to have tablet support in the near future as well.
