# APA
Autonomous Precision Agriculture with UAVs

## About the project 
This mobile application aims to provide farmers with localized insights about their fields, by using drone technology to capture multi-spectral images of their crops. 
Insights are generated by our image processing pipeline, as well as our high-fidelity agricultural data source.   
Through an intuitive dashboard, farmers are able to automatically track historical field status. 
We strive to have tablet support in the near future as well.


## Getting started
Build a release version of the app for deployment:
````
flutter build
````
Run unit and widget tests for the Flutter project:
````
flutter test
````
Download dependencies for the Flutter project from Pub, the package manager for Dart
````
flutter pub get
````
Upgrade the dependencies for the Flutter project to the latest available versions
````
flutter pub upgrade
````
Clean the build files generated by Flutter, which can help to resolve issues with the build process
````
flutter clean
````
Get information about installed tooling required for Flutter development
````
flutter doctor
````

## Run frontend application
Run the Flutter project on an attached device or emulator:
````
flutter run
````

## Setup environment

In order to be able to use Google Maps API, several steps need to be taken with regards to private key configuration.

- Create an account in https://console.developers.google.com/ and add our APA project (if not done so yet), in order to fetch your private API key for Google Maps.
- To run on Android - add the following to the `src/apa_app/android/local.properties` file:
````
GMapsAPIKey={YOUR_PRIVATE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}
````` 
- To run on iOS - add the following to the `src/apa_app/ios/Flutter/Debug.xcconfig` file:
```` 
#include "Generated.xcconfig"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY={YOUR_PRIVATE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}
````
Note that `local.properties` and `Debug.xcconfig` are both under `.gitignore`.
- To access env vars from source code - create a `.env` file under the `lib` directory with the following contents:
````
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY={YOUR_PRIVATE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}
````
